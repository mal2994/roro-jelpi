1. make sure test steps are commented out in lua
1. export index.html
2. manually add <script> to index.html at the end (see below snippet)
3. test locally - start a webserver to prevent CORS issues by running `python3 -m http.server` (b.c. of CORS issue introduced when fetching `credits.html` hmmm)
3. make sure test steps are commented out in js
4. git commit
4. deploy
* if you are doing any testing -- extract the blob first and put it in the code so you dont erase all the high scores!

from step 2:
```
<script src="script.js"></script>
<script src="credits.js"></script>
```
